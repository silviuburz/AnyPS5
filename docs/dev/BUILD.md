# Build

## Relinker only

The relinker can be built without initializing submodules or configuring SDL, Vulkan, FFmpeg, FreeType or the shader recompiler. It requires CMake, a C++20 compiler and a build tool. Python 3 enables the Python regression tests.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-relinker -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DANYPS5_RELINKER_ONLY=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-relinker --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-relinker --output-on-failure
```

This mode builds the conversion tool and its tests on Linux, Windows and macOS, including Apple Silicon. macOS uses AppleClang from the Xcode command-line tools; Windows uses the MinGW-w64 toolchain below. The executable is `build-relinker/core/relinker/relinker` (`relinker.exe` on Windows with Ninja).

With Python on Linux x86-64, CTest automatically runs `linux_entry_argv` and `execution_harness`. The fixture converts and executes a synthetic guest; JSON reports are written to `build-relinker/tests/execution-reports/`. Its deliberate SIGTRAP/SIGILL outcomes verify only the synthetic argv contract, not PS5 equivalence. Other hosts retain the conversion check; configurations without Python visibly omit Python tests. No additional packages or default-build changes are required.

The output remains x86-64 Linux ELF or Windows PE. Converted games need system libraries built for the target OS and a compatible x86-64 host. This mode does not build those libraries or provide macOS game execution. Tests inspect both output formats; execution checks run only on their compatible hosts.

Use a separate build directory for the full build.

## Full build

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Requirements

- x86-64, Git, CMake 3.22.1 or newer, Ninja, C++20.
- Linux: GCC, G++, binutils. SDL's X11 backend requires X11 and Xext development headers (`libx11-dev` and `libxext-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- Windows: only MinGW-w64 GCC 15.2.0 (WinLibs `x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh`, release `15.2.0posix-14.0.0-ucrt-r7`) is currently supported. Add its `mingw64/bin` directory to `PATH` before configuring.
- FFmpeg binaries are downloaded during configuration unless `FFMPEG_PREBUILT_DIR` is set. With the WinLibs CMake, the download fails with status 60 (`SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK`) unless `SSL_CERT_FILE` names a CA bundle, for example `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\etc\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt` from Git for Windows, as in CI.

## Commands

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --build build --target libs --parallel
```

`libs` is a custom target: every library under [core/libs/prx](../../core/libs/prx) is built with
`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`, so the first command alone does not produce them. Titles load the patched `.prx`
files from `build/core/libs/libs`, which only that second step refreshes. Running a title after a
library change without it therefore tests the previous binaries and can show no effect at all.

## CMake flags

Project switches accept `ON` or `OFF`:

| Flag                             | Default | Effect                                           |
|----------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`             | `OFF`   | Build and register tests.                        |
| `-DANYPS5_RELINKER_ONLY=ON`      | `OFF`   | Build only the relinker and its tests, without third-party dependencies. |
| `-DANYPS5_ENABLE_SPIRV_TOOLS=ON` | `OFF`   | Enable SPIR-V validation and optimization.       |
| `-DAPS5_ENABLE_TIMING_LOG=ON`    | `OFF`   | Compile frame timing logging.                    |
| `-DAPS5_AGC_CREATE_LOG=OFF`      | `ON`    | Disable successful `sceAgcCreateShader` logging. |
| `-DAGC_BUILD_VISUAL_TEST=ON`     | `OFF`   | Build the standalone AGC SPIR-V visual test.     |

Build configuration parameters:

| Flag                                   | Value                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`           | `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, or `MinSizeRel`.             |
| `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc`               | C compiler name or absolute path.                                  |
| `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++`             | C++ compiler name or absolute path.                                |
| `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`   | Optional C compiler cache; requires `ccache`.                      |
| `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache` | Optional C++ compiler cache; requires `ccache`.                    |
| `-DFFMPEG_PREBUILT_DIR=<path>`         | Unpacked FFmpeg package for the target platform; empty by default. |

SDL and FreeType settings forced by the root `CMakeLists.txt` cannot be overridden with `-D`.

## Pipeline statistics

Set `APS5_PIPELINE_STATS=1` to capture and print driver statistics for each newly created graphics or compute pipeline. This requires `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties` and `pipelineExecutableInfo`; an unsupported device fails with an error. Statistic names and units are driver-specific. Capturing statistics can increase pipeline compilation cost. The setting is disabled by default.

## Shader recompiler

The shader recompilation logic in [core/shader/recompiler](../../core/shader/recompiler) is isolated from the rest of the project and is a pure function of its input data, designed for integration into any other project. The current CMake target also includes cache support and links a supplied runtime target, glslang, and optionally SPIRV-Tools.
